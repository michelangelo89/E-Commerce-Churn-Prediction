# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and predicting customer churn in an e-commerce business. We use a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), A/B testing, predictive modeling, and causal inference to gain insights and optimize customer retention strategies.

---

## ðŸš€ Business Problem
Customer churn is a critical problem for e-commerce businesses. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to:
- âœ… Identify key factors driving customer churn.
- âœ… Build a predictive model to identify high-risk customers.
- âœ… Design and test targeted retention strategies using A/B testing.
- âœ… Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

---

## âœ… Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution and feature relationships.
   - Identifying key factors associated with churn.

2. **A/B Testing Design and Implementation**
   - Designing A/B tests for retention strategies.
   - Measuring the impact of different retention approaches.

3. **Churn Prediction Model**
   - Building a predictive model (Logistic Regression).
   - Evaluating model performance (98% accuracy).

4. **Causal Inference Analysis**
   - Comparing feature importance (Random Forest) with statistical significance.
   - Identifying actionable and predictive features.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Results and Insights
- ðŸš€ The model achieved **98% accuracy** in predicting churn.
- ðŸš€ **Retention Opportunity Score** was the most important feature for prediction.
- ðŸš€ **Tenure, ComplaintRate, and DaySinceLastOrder** were the most actionable features (statistically significant).
- ðŸš€ A/B testing showed that **loyalty strategies were most effective for retention**.
